# Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier — Project Overview

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)** classifier from scratch using Python.  
The goals of this project are to:

- Introduce the mathematical foundations behind Gaussian Naive Bayes  
- Describe numerical techniques and provide pseudocode  
- Implement the model without using sklearn’s GaussianNB  
- Reproduce sklearn classification results using our own implementation  
- Provide a reproducible development environment for others  

The implementation includes:

- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of class priors, means, and variances  
- Log-likelihood computation for numerical stability  
- Variance smoothing to avoid division-by-zero  
- Custom accuracy and loss functions  
- Experimental comparison to sklearn’s GaussianNB  

This work demonstrates understanding of generative machine learning models, numerical stability issues, and replicability.
